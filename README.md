# Smart Parking Management System  

## Overview  
This project is a **Smart Parking Management System** designed to streamline vehicle entry, exit, and space utilization. It combines **RFID-based access control**, a **ticketing system**, **gate automation**, and **traffic light signaling**, all connected to a **central server** over Ethernet. The system integrates with a desktop/mobile application for **real-time monitoring, ticket validation, and reporting**.  

The solution improves **security**, reduces **traffic congestion**, and ensures **efficient space utilization** in modern parking facilities.
